## Introduction

CoderDojo is a global movement of free, volunteer-led, community-based programming clubs, called Dojos. Young people aged seven to seventeen can visit a Dojo where they can learn with the support of volunteers to code, build a website, create an app or a game, and explore technology in an informal, creative, and social environment.

Once completed you should:
+ Understand the different roles volunteers have in a Dojo
+ Understand what mentoring means at a Dojo
+ Recognise different mentoring styles used at a Dojo
+ Know a little about the most popular coding languages used in Dojos
+ Know what resources are available to support mentors
